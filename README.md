# PureBalanceFormatter

ATTENTION!
This plugin requires some sort of Economy Plugin (Essentials) and Vault!


PureBalanceFormatter is an excellent plugin, if you want an easy and customizable economy experience. PBF gives the access to control your formatting system, and with an active developer, it will keep growing.


Easy and customizable formatting system
